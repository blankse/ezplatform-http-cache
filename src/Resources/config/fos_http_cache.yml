    # WARNING: Please don't use the TagHandler from FOS yet in generic reusable code:
    # 1. Until 2.x it is hardcoded to use comma separated list of tags, which won't work on Fastly and
    #    will conflict with the one header per key format we currently use with xkey (as per their doc)
    # 2. In FosHttpCache 1.x it is only available if proxy client is configured as "varnish" or "custom"
